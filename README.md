# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to showcase the knowledge and skills acquired in the [Getting and Cleaning Data Course by Johns Hopkins University at Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning
).

The main contents of this repository, as required in the project instructions, are:

* The [tidy dataset](https://github.com/jclopeztavera/human-activity/blob/master/data/tidy_data.csv).
* The [R script](https://github.com/jclopeztavera/human-activity/blob/master/R/run_analysis.R) for performing the analyses.
* The [codebook](https://github.com/jclopeztavera/human-activity/blob/master/R/CodeBook.md) that describes the variables, the data, and the data transformations performed.


## Usage

1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/jclopeztavera/human-activity.git`.
2. Open the [R-project file](https://github.com/jclopeztavera/human-activity/blob/master/human-activity.Rproj).
3. Source the `run_analysis.R` file .
4. Drop me a line if you find any areas for improvement.


## To do

- [x] Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- [x] Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- [x] Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- [x] Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
- [ ] From the data set in the previous step , create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## Review criteria
- [x] The submitted data set is tidy.
- [x] The Github repo contains the required scripts.
- [ ] GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available code books with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
- [x] The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
- [ ] The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.


## Built With

* [R version 3.3.2](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/) (2016-10-31) -- "Sincere Pumpkin Patch".
* Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0 (64-bit).
* [RStudio Desktop 1.0.136](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) - makes R easier to use.
