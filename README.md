# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to showcase the knowledge and skills acquired in the [Getting and Cleaning Data Course by Johns Hopkins University at Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning
).


## To do

- [ ] Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- [ ] Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- [ ] Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- [ ] Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
- [ ] From the data set in the previous step , create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## Review criteria
- [ ] The submitted data set is tidy.
- [ ] The Github repo contains the required scripts.
- [ ] GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
- [ ] The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
- [ ] The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.
