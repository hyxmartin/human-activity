## loading the tidy data
library(data.table)

## From the data set in the previous step/script, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
by_activity <- tidy_data %>%
    group_by(activity, acceleration, domain) %>%
    filter(parameter == "mean", axis == "") %>%

### Exporting to csv
